                        <h4>Course Recommender Program</h4>
                        <p>This is a project that I made for my INST326 class, where I developed a course recommender program using 
                            Python that searches for courses based on keywords and department names. Led a team of two members in implementing 
                            the program and utilized SQLite as the database management system to store course information and sections.
                            Designed and implemented web scraping functionality using Selenium to extract course data from a website.

                        <p>In collaboration with a team, I'm designing a relational database to capture NYPD-reported motor vehicle collisions 
                            since July 1st, 2012. We're analyzing a dataset of over 100,000 rows, using SQL to focus on key collision factors 
                            and vehicle types. Our final deliverable will include a report outlining the database's development, challenges, 
                            strengths, and suggestions for future enhancements.

                        <p>My team and I are vurrently making a dedicated website to showcase our app concept centered 
                            on student health and wellness. This platform will serve to show our user experience research 
                            and the iterative design prototypes we've developed. More than just a display of our work, the website will provide 
                            a detailed narrative of our processes, reflecting our commitment to transparency and collaboration.</p>

                        <p>I worked with a group of five on an app concept we named "Animeet." It's designed to be both a 
                            database for anime content and a social platform. We gathered user feedback to shape the app's 
                            features and used Canva to create design mockups. Our team then put together a presentation to 
                            highlight the concept and its functionalities.                        </p>

                        <p>Together with a dedicated team, we conceptualized an app focused on student health and wellness. 
                            We started with a comprehensive user experience research to grasp the essential requirements, 
                            from which we derived our design principles. While we continue to refine the concept through iterative prototypes.</p>
